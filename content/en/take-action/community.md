# Join Our Community

**You're not alone in navigating AI's impact.**

Across Europe, people are asking the same questions you are: How does this AI system affect me? What are my rights? What can I do? By connecting with others, we learn from shared experiences, build collective knowledge, and amplify our voices.

This isn't just a community—it's a movement for technology that respects human rights and dignity.

---

## Why Community Matters

### Share Experiences

When you've dealt with an AI system—whether you successfully challenged a decision or hit a wall—your experience helps others. What worked? What didn't? What would you do differently?

### Learn from Others

Someone else has probably faced what you're facing. Their insights can save you time, help you avoid mistakes, and give you ideas you wouldn't have had on your own.

### Collective Voice

One person asking questions is easy to ignore. A community demanding answers is not. Together, we can push for transparency, accountability, and respect for rights.

### Stay Connected

AI governance is evolving fast. Being part of a community keeps you connected to developments, opportunities, and people who share your concerns.
