# Practical steps

This section collects practical, low-friction actions you can take when AI systems affect decisions about you, your organization, or the services you rely on.

The goal is not activism—it’s clarity and follow-through: understand what applies, request the right information, keep records, and know when to escalate.

## Four practical pathways

### 1) Rights and requests

Templates and checklists to help you request information, explanations, or human review where applicable.

- template letters for requesting information and documentation
- checklists for common AI-affected scenarios
- guidance for filing complaints or escalating internally
- documentation tips (what to save and why)

### 2) Stay informed

Brief updates on changes and interpretations as the EU AI Act is implemented.

- periodic digest (regulation + practical takeaways)
- links to primary sources and reputable summaries
- update notes for this site’s checklists

### 3) Compare notes

If you want to share experiences or learn how others handled similar situations, community discussions can help.

- share patterns and pitfalls (without exposing personal data)
- ask questions and learn from examples
- contribute improvements to this open-source site

### 4) Workshops and events

Occasional sessions focused on practical compliance and governance.

- workshops on documentation, risk assessment, and oversight
- discussions with practitioners

## Quick start

Pick one:

- **5 minutes**: bookmark the relevant checklist and note where AI appears in your workflow
- **15 minutes**: use a template request letter and customize it
- **30 minutes**: write a short risk/impact note (what the system does, who it affects, what could go wrong)
