# When Algorithms Decide: Your Rights

Algorithms now influence some of life's biggest decisions—whether you get a loan, a job, benefits, or medical treatment. You have the right to know when algorithms are involved and to challenge decisions that affect you.

## Where Algorithms Make Decisions

You might not always see them, but algorithms are working behind the scenes in:

### Financial Services
- **Credit scoring** - Whether you're approved for a loan or mortgage
- **Insurance pricing** - What you pay for car, home, or health insurance
- **Fraud detection** - Whether your transaction is flagged or blocked
- **Investment advice** - Automated recommendations for your money

### Employment
- **Resume screening** - Whether your application reaches a human
- **Interview scheduling** - Which candidates get called back
- **Performance scoring** - How your work is evaluated
- **Promotion decisions** - Who gets considered for advancement

### Public Services
- **Benefits eligibility** - Whether you qualify for support
- **Social services** - Risk assessments and case prioritization
- **Tax assessments** - Flagging returns for review
- **Public housing** - Allocation and priority decisions

### Healthcare
- **Diagnostic support** - AI-assisted medical diagnoses
- **Treatment recommendations** - Suggested care pathways
- **Resource allocation** - Prioritizing appointments or procedures
- **Insurance approvals** - Pre-authorization decisions

### Education
- **Admissions** - University and school applications
- **Grading assistance** - AI-supported assessment
- **Student monitoring** - Attendance and performance tracking
- **Proctoring** - AI-watched exams

## Your Legal Protections

Two major laws protect you:

### GDPR Article 22: Protection from Automated Decisions

You have the right **not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing** that significantly affects you. This means:

✓ Automated decisions need **human involvement** for significant outcomes
✓ You can request **human review** of automated decisions
✓ You're entitled to an **explanation** of the decision
✓ You can **contest** the decision and express your view

### EU AI Act: High-Risk System Requirements

AI systems used in these areas are classified as **high-risk** and must:

✓ Be tested for **accuracy, robustness, and bias**
✓ Have **human oversight** built in
✓ Provide **transparency** about how they work
✓ Maintain **records** for accountability
✓ Be registered in an **EU database** (for public-sector use)

## When to Push Back: A Decision Tree

Ask yourself these questions:

**1. Was AI or an algorithm involved in this decision?**
- If you don't know, ask. You have the right to be told.

**2. Does the decision significantly affect you?**
- Employment, credit, housing, benefits, healthcare—these are significant.

**3. Was there meaningful human involvement?**
- A human rubber-stamping AI output doesn't count as real oversight.

**4. Does the outcome seem wrong or unfair?**
- Trust your judgment. If something feels off, it's worth questioning.

**If you answered yes to these, you likely have grounds to push back.**

## How to Exercise Your Rights

### Step 1: Request Information

Write to the organization asking:

> I am writing to request information under GDPR Articles 13-15 and 22.
>
> Regarding the recent decision about [describe the decision], please tell me:
> 1. Was any automated decision-making or AI system involved in this decision?
> 2. If so, what is the logic involved in the automated processing?
> 3. What information was used to make this decision?
> 4. What is the significance and potential consequences of such processing for me?
>
> Please respond within one month as required by law.

### Step 2: Request Human Review

If you learn AI was involved:

> I am exercising my right under GDPR Article 22(3) to obtain human intervention in the decision regarding [describe the decision].
>
> I request that a qualified person reviews my case, taking into account the following points I wish to express:
>
> [List your concerns or additional information]
>
> I also request the opportunity to contest this decision.

### Step 3: Challenge the Decision

If human review doesn't resolve the issue:

> I am not satisfied with the outcome of the human review of [the decision].
>
> I believe the decision is [incorrect/unfair/discriminatory] because:
>
> [Explain your reasoning]
>
> I request a formal review of this decision and ask that you explain how my concerns have been addressed.

### Step 4: Escalate If Necessary

If the organization doesn't respond appropriately:

**File a complaint** with your national data protection authority
- They can investigate and order remedies
- Complaints are free to file

**Contact sector regulators** for industry-specific issues
- Financial services regulators for banking/insurance
- Healthcare regulators for medical decisions
- Employment tribunals for workplace decisions

**Seek legal advice** for significant harm
- You may be entitled to compensation for damages

## What Makes a Good Response from an Organization?

When you ask for information or human review, a good response should include:

✅ Clear confirmation of whether AI was involved
✅ Understandable explanation of how the system works
✅ The specific factors that influenced your decision
✅ Evidence that a real human reviewed your case
✅ A clear explanation of the outcome
✅ Information about further appeals

## Red Flags in Responses

Watch out for:

🚩 **Refusal to confirm AI use** - They must tell you
🚩 **Vague explanations** - "The system decided" isn't enough
🚩 **No human involvement** - Rubber-stamping doesn't count
🚩 **No appeal option** - You should have recourse
🚩 **Ignoring your concerns** - They must consider what you say

## Examples of Successful Challenges

**Credit decision reversed** - A person denied credit asked for explanation, discovered an error in data used, and had the decision reversed after human review.

**Benefits reinstated** - An automated benefits cut was reversed when the individual showed the algorithm didn't account for their circumstances.

**Job application reconsidered** - A screened-out candidate requested review, and was interviewed after showing the AI missed relevant qualifications.

**These outcomes are possible because of your rights.**
