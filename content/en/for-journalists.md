### 📰 Story Angles

AI stories are everywhere. Here are some angles worth investigating:

#### Workplace Surveillance
Workers are being monitored by AI in unprecedented ways. From productivity scoring to emotion detection, there are stories of workers pushing back—and of practices that cross legal lines.

#### AI in Public Services
When government uses AI to allocate benefits, detect fraud, or make decisions about citizens, the stakes are highest. Mistakes can devastate lives, and public trust is at risk.

## Why This Matters

**AI systems are increasingly making decisions that affect millions of people—often with little transparency or accountability.** When algorithms determine who gets hired, who gets benefits, who gets surveilled, or who gets opportunities, the public deserves to know how these decisions are made.

Journalists and activists serve as a crucial check on power. You:

- **Investigate** what institutions don't want to reveal
- **Amplify** stories of people affected by AI systems
- **Translate** complex regulations into public understanding
- **Hold** deployers and developers accountable

The EU AI Act creates new transparency requirements and new rights for individuals. But rights only matter if people know they exist—and if they're enforced.

**Your work makes that possible.**
