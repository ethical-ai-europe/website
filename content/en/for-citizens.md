# AI Affects Your Family. Know Your Rights.

**Whether AI is making decisions about your job, your children's education, or your access to services, you deserve to understand what's happening—and you have the power to do something about it.**

You're not alone in wondering about these things. Many people share the same concerns.

## Your Concerns Are Valid

### "Is AI watching me at work?"
Yes, workplace surveillance is increasingly common—but there are limits. Some practices are restricted or even banned under European law.

### "What about my children's school?"
AI is entering classrooms through learning apps, plagiarism detection, and student monitoring. Parents have the right to know what's being used.

### "Can I trust AI decisions about me?"
When algorithms decide on your loan, your job application, or your benefits, you have the right to understand why—and to challenge unfair decisions.

### "What happens to my data?"
Your personal information is valuable. European law gives you control over how it's used, especially when AI is involved.

## 3 Things You Can Do Today

1. **Ask one question.** Next time AI might be involved in a decision about you, ask: "Was any automated system or algorithm involved in this decision?"

2. **Check your children's school.** Ask what AI tools are being used, what data is collected, and how long it's kept.

3. **Review one policy.** Look at your employer's IT policy or a service's privacy policy. Are they being transparent about AI use?

## Why This Matters for You

**AI isn't a future problem—it's a today problem.** Algorithms are already making decisions that affect your job, your children's education, your credit, and your access to services.

But here's the good news: **European law is on your side.** The EU AI Act and GDPR give you real rights—the right to know, the right to explanation, the right to human review, and the right to challenge unfair decisions.

You don't need to be a tech expert or a lawyer. You just need to know what questions to ask and where to find help.

**That's why we're here.**
