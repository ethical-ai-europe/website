# AI in Hiring & Recruitment

When you apply for a job today, there's a good chance AI is involved—from screening your resume to analyzing your video interview. For job seekers and HR professionals alike, understanding these systems is essential.

## How AI Is Used in Hiring

### CV and Resume Screening
AI parses applications to filter candidates based on keywords, qualifications, or predicted fit. Many applications never reach human eyes.

### Video Interview Analysis
AI analyzes recorded interviews, assessing word choice, facial expressions, tone of voice, or body language to score candidates.

### Skills Assessments
AI-powered tests evaluate technical abilities, cognitive skills, or personality traits, often as a first-round filter.

### Candidate Ranking and Matching
Algorithms rank candidates by predicted success or fit, determining who advances to interviews.

### Chatbots and Automated Communication
AI handles initial candidate questions, schedules interviews, and sends updates—often without human involvement.

### Automated Rejections
AI can send rejection notices without human review, especially at early stages.

### Reference and Background Checks
AI aggregates information from databases, social media, or other sources about candidates.

## The Problem: Documented Bias Issues

AI hiring tools have been repeatedly shown to perpetuate or amplify discrimination:

### Known Issues
- **Amazon's recruiting tool** (discontinued in 2018) learned to penalize resumes that included the word "women's"
- **Facial analysis systems** have shown bias against people with darker skin and non-Western facial features
- **Language models** may penalize non-native speakers or regional dialects
- **Historical hiring data** often encodes past discrimination, which AI then learns and repeats
- **Keyword matching** can exclude qualified candidates who describe their experience differently

### Who Is Affected
Bias in AI hiring can disproportionately impact:
- Women
- Racial and ethnic minorities
- People with disabilities
- Older workers
- Non-native speakers
- Career changers or those with non-traditional paths

The efficiency AI promises can come at the cost of fairness.

## EU AI Act: Employment AI Is High-Risk

Under the EU AI Act, AI systems used in employment contexts are classified as **high-risk**, including:

- Recruitment and selection (placing job advertisements, screening, filtering, evaluating candidates)
- Decisions on promotion and termination
- Task allocation and performance monitoring
- Evaluating work performance

### What This Means

High-risk classification requires:

✓ **Transparency**: Organizations must inform you that AI is used in recruitment

✓ **Human oversight**: Significant decisions must have human involvement

✓ **Bias testing**: Systems must be tested for discriminatory effects

✓ **Documentation**: Records of how systems work and have been validated

✓ **Accuracy**: Systems must meet quality and reliability standards

✓ **Data quality**: Training data must be relevant and representative

## Your Rights as a Candidate

### Right to Know AI Is Being Used

Employers must tell you when AI is involved in hiring decisions. Under GDPR, you have the right to be informed about automated decision-making.

### Right to Explanation If Rejected

If AI was involved in rejecting your application, you can ask for an explanation of how the decision was made.

### Right to Human Review

You can request that a human reviews any significant automated decision. This is especially important if you've been rejected at early stages without human involvement.

### Right to Object

If you believe AI has treated you unfairly, you have the right to object. This doesn't guarantee a different outcome, but it must be taken seriously.

### Right to Non-Discrimination

AI cannot lawfully discriminate based on protected characteristics—even if it does so indirectly through proxies like name, address, or graduation year.

### Right to Your Data

You can request information about what data was processed about you during recruitment.

## Practical Tips for Job Seekers

### How to Ask If AI Was Used

You can inquire at any point in the process:

**Before applying:**
> "Does your recruitment process use any automated screening, AI analysis, or algorithmic decision-making tools?"

**After rejection:**
> "I would like to understand how my application was evaluated. Was any automated system or AI involved in the decision? I am requesting this information under GDPR Article 15."

**When invited to video interview:**
> "Will this video interview be analyzed by AI? What aspects are assessed, and how?"

### How to Request Human Review

If you've been rejected and believe AI was involved:

> "I am writing regarding my recent application for [position].
>
> I understand that automated screening or AI may have been involved in evaluating my application. Under GDPR Article 22, I request human review of my application.
>
> I believe I am qualified for this role based on [briefly explain]. I ask that a hiring manager reviews my application directly, taking into account the points above.
>
> Please confirm receipt and let me know the outcome of this review."

### Template Language for Candidates

**Requesting information about AI use:**

> Subject: GDPR Information Request - Recruitment Process
>
> Dear [Company],
>
> I recently applied for / participated in the recruitment process for [position]. Under GDPR Articles 13-15 and 22, I request the following information:
>
> 1. Was any automated decision-making, AI, or algorithmic system used to evaluate my application?
> 2. If so, what is the logic involved in this automated processing?
> 3. What information about me was considered?
> 4. What is the significance and intended consequences of such processing?
>
> Please respond within one month as required by law.

**Challenging a decision:**

> Subject: Request for Human Review of Application Decision
>
> Dear [Company],
>
> I recently received a rejection for [position]. I am exercising my right under GDPR Article 22 to request human intervention in this decision.
>
> I ask that a qualified person reviews my application, considering that [explain your qualifications or concerns].
>
> I also request the opportunity to understand and contest this decision.
>
> Please confirm you have received this request and advise on next steps.

## For Employers: Compliance Obligations

If you use AI in hiring, you must:

### Before Deployment
- **Conduct risk assessments** for any AI hiring tools
- **Test for bias** against protected groups before use
- **Document** how systems work and what data they use
- **Train staff** who interact with or oversee AI systems

### During Use
- **Inform candidates** that AI is being used and how
- **Ensure human oversight** for consequential decisions
- **Maintain records** of AI-assisted decisions
- **Monitor for problems** and unexpected patterns

### Bias Auditing Requirements
High-risk AI systems must be tested for:
- Accuracy and performance across demographic groups
- Potential for discrimination, direct or indirect
- Fairness in outcomes over time

Auditing should be ongoing, not one-time.

### When Candidates Exercise Rights
- Respond to information requests within one month
- Provide meaningful explanations, not boilerplate
- Actually conduct human review when requested—not rubber-stamping
- Take objections and complaints seriously

### Consequences of Non-Compliance
Under the EU AI Act, penalties can reach:
- Up to €35 million or 7% of global turnover for serious violations
- Administrative orders to stop using non-compliant systems
- Reputational damage and legal liability

## Red Flags for Job Seekers

🚩 **No disclosure**: No mention of AI in recruitment process

🚩 **Instant rejection**: Rejection within hours of applying (suggests automated screening)

🚩 **Video interview emphasis**: Heavy focus on recorded video with no human interaction

🚩 **Personality tests**: Extensive personality assessments without clear relevance

🚩 **Vague feedback**: "Not a fit" without explanation

🚩 **No human contact**: Inability to reach an actual person in the process

🚩 **Unusual data requests**: Requests for information that seems irrelevant

## Red Flags for Employers

🚩 **Vendor promises**: Claims of perfect accuracy or zero bias

🚩 **Black box systems**: Inability to explain how a tool makes decisions

🚩 **No validation**: Vendor cannot provide bias testing for your population

🚩 **Excessive efficiency**: Tool that rejects vast majority of candidates

🚩 **Complaints emerging**: Candidates raising concerns about fairness

## What You Can Do

**Job seekers:**
- Ask about AI use in every application process
