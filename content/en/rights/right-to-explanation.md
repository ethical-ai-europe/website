# Your Right to an AI Explanation

When an AI system makes or influences a decision about you, you don't have to accept "the computer said no." You have the right to understand why—and this guide shows you how to get that explanation.

## What This Right Means

Under European law, you have the right to **meaningful information about the logic involved** when automated systems process your data in ways that affect you. This isn't just a technical detail—it's about your ability to:

- **Understand** what happened and why
- **Check** if the decision was fair and correct
- **Challenge** outcomes that seem wrong
- **Learn** what you could do differently if appropriate

Think of it as the AI equivalent of getting your exam back with marks and comments, not just a grade.

## What You Can Expect to Get

A good explanation should tell you:

### The Basics
- ✅ **Confirmation that AI was used**
- ✅ **The type of decision or prediction made**
- ✅ **The outcome of the decision**

### The Reasoning
- ✅ **What factors the AI considered** (the inputs)
- ✅ **Which factors were most important** in your specific case
- ✅ **The general logic** of how the system works
- ✅ **Any thresholds or rules** that affected the outcome

### The Context
- ✅ **What data about you was used**
- ✅ **Where that data came from**
- ✅ **The consequences** of the decision for you

## What You Cannot Always Expect

Some things may not be provided:

- ❌ **The complete algorithm or source code** - This may be protected as a trade secret, though your right to explanation still applies
- ❌ **Real-time technical details** - The explanation should be understandable, not a data science report
- ❌ **Certainty about counterfactuals** - They may not be able to say exactly what would have changed the outcome
- ❌ **Perfect accuracy** - AI systems are probabilistic; explanations reflect this

**Important:** The law balances transparency with legitimate business interests, but your right to a meaningful explanation cannot be overridden by claims of trade secrets alone.

## How to Request an Explanation

### Template Request

Send this to the organization (email or letter):

**Subject: Request for Explanation of Automated Decision**

Dear [Organization/Data Controller],

I am writing regarding a decision that was made about me on [date] concerning [describe: loan application, job application, benefits claim, etc.].

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (Articles 13, 14, 15, and 22) and the EU AI Act, I request the following information:

1. **Confirmation** of whether automated decision-making or AI profiling was involved in this decision.

2. **Meaningful information about the logic involved**, including:
   - The main factors or criteria the system considered
   - Which factors were most significant in my specific case
   - How these factors led to the decision made about me

3. **The specific data about me** that was used in this decision and its source.

4. **The intended consequences** of this processing for me.

5. **My rights** regarding this decision, including how to request human review.

Please respond within one month as required by GDPR Article 12.

If any part of this request is unclear, please contact me for clarification rather than refusing to respond.

Yours faithfully,
[Your name]
[Your contact information]

### Tips for Effective Requests

**Be specific** - Reference the exact decision you're asking about

**Put it in writing** - Email or letter creates a record

**Use the law** - Mentioning GDPR and the AI Act signals you know your rights

**Set expectations** - The one-month deadline is legally required

**Stay polite but firm** - You're exercising a right, not asking a favor

## What Makes a Good vs. Inadequate Explanation

### ✅ A Good Explanation

"Your loan application was declined based on our automated credit assessment. The main factors were:

1. **Credit history (high importance)** - Your credit file shows missed payments in the last 12 months
2. **Debt-to-income ratio (medium importance)** - Your existing debts are 45% of your income, above our threshold of 40%
3. **Employment stability (low importance)** - Your current employment of 8 months met our minimum requirement

The system is designed to predict repayment likelihood. Your overall score was 58, below our threshold of 65. You may request a human review or reapply after addressing the factors above."

**Why this works:** Specific, personal, actionable, with clear next steps.

### ❌ An Inadequate Explanation

"Your application was assessed by our system and declined based on our internal criteria. We cannot share details of our proprietary scoring methodology. This decision was made in accordance with our policies."

**Why this fails:** Vague, not personal, no actionable information, hides behind secrecy.

## What to Do If the Explanation Is Inadequate

### Push Back

> Thank you for your response. However, the explanation provided does not meet the requirements of GDPR Articles 13-15 and 22, which require "meaningful information about the logic involved."
>
> The response you provided does not tell me:
> - Which specific factors affected my decision
> - How those factors led to the outcome
> - What I could do to achieve a different result
>
> Please provide a more detailed explanation within 14 days. If I do not receive an adequate response, I will file a complaint with [your national data protection authority].

### Escalate

If they still don't provide adequate information:

**1. File a complaint with your data protection authority**
- Free to do in all EU countries
- They can investigate and order compliance
- Find your authority at edpb.europa.eu

**2. Contact sector regulators**
- Financial services: banking/insurance regulators
- Healthcare: health service regulators
- Employment: labor rights agencies

**3. Seek legal advice**
- Consumer protection lawyers
- Data protection specialists
- Civil liberties organizations

## The Right to Explanation in Practice

Remember:

📝 **Document everything** - Keep copies of your requests and their responses

⏰ **Know the timelines** - They have one month to respond, extendable to three for complex cases

🎯 **Be specific** - The more specific your request, the harder it is to dodge

💪 **Don't give up** - Inadequate responses are themselves potential violations

🤝 **You're not alone** - Data protection authorities exist to help you
