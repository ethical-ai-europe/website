# About the EU AI Act

The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act represents the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence. Adopted in 2024, it establishes harmonized rules for the development, deployment, and use of AI systems across the EU.

## Key Objectives

The EU AI Act aims to:

- **Ensure AI systems are safe and respect fundamental rights**
- **Foster innovation while protecting citizens**
- **Create legal certainty for businesses**
- **Establish a risk-based approach to AI regulation**

## Risk-Based Classification

The Act categorizes AI systems into four risk levels:

### Unacceptable Risk
AI systems that pose a clear threat to safety, livelihoods, and rights are prohibited. Examples include:
- Social scoring systems by governments
- Real-time biometric identification in public spaces (with limited exceptions)
- AI that manipulates human behavior

### High Risk
Systems that significantly impact health, safety, or fundamental rights require strict compliance, including:
- AI in critical infrastructure
- Educational and vocational training systems
- Employment and worker management
- Essential services (credit scoring, emergency response)
- Law enforcement applications
- Biometric identification systems

### Limited Risk
Systems with specific transparency obligations, such as:
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Emotion recognition systems
- Deepfakes and synthetic media

### Minimal Risk
Most AI applications with no or minimal risk, including:
- AI-enabled video games
- Spam filters
- Recommendation systems

## Compliance and Enforcement

Organizations deploying high-risk AI systems must ensure:
- Risk management systems
- High-quality training data
- Detailed documentation and record-keeping
- Transparency and user information
- Human oversight capabilities
- Robustness and cybersecurity measures

Non-compliance can result in significant fines up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.

## Timeline

- **2024**: Act adopted and enters into force
- **2025-2027**: Phased implementation
- **2027**: Full application of all provisions

## Why It Matters

The EU AI Act sets a global precedent for AI governance, influencing how organizations worldwide approach AI development and deployment. Understanding and complying with these regulations is essential for:

- **Businesses** operating in or with the European market
- **Developers** creating AI systems
- **Citizens** whose rights and safety are protected
- **Policymakers** shaping future AI regulations globally
