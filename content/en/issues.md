# Impacts and trade-offs

AI affects society through many channels: how decisions are made, what information is surfaced, how work is organized, and how services are delivered. Regulation (including the EU AI Act) covers part of this landscape, but broader questions remain relevant for product teams, organizations, and individuals.

This section is designed to be explanatory and practical. Where possible, it highlights common risk patterns, trade-offs, and mitigation options rather than promoting a specific policy position.

## Topics

### Labor and work

AI can change the workplace through automation, decision support, and monitoring. Key questions often include:
- which tasks are being automated vs. augmented
- how accountability and oversight are handled
- what controls exist for monitoring and performance management

### Economic impact

AI can create value through productivity gains and new products, while also introducing concentration risks (data, compute, and talent). Common questions include:
- who captures value in AI-enabled markets
- how smaller firms can adopt and compete
- what dependencies exist in the AI supply chain

### Democracy and society

AI can influence public discourse via ranking, recommendation, and synthetic media. Practical concerns often include:
- provenance and disclosure for synthetic content
- robustness against manipulation and abuse
- governance and accountability for high-reach systems

### Surveillance and privacy

AI can enable more scalable surveillance, including biometric identification and behavioral inference, depending on the deployment context. Key questions often include:
- what data is collected and how long it is retained
- where biometric or sensitive processing is used
- what notice, access, and review mechanisms exist
