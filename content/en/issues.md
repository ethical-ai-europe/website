# Understanding the Issues

AI is reshaping society in ways that go far beyond what any single law or regulation can address. While the EU AI Act sets important boundaries, the deeper questions remain: How will AI change work? Who benefits from its productivity gains? What happens to democracy when algorithms shape what we see and believe? How do we preserve privacy in an age of ubiquitous surveillance?

These are the conversations Europe—and the world—is having right now. They don't have easy answers, and they need diverse voices to shape them.

## The Issues That Matter

### 🏭 Labor and Work

AI is transforming the workplace in profound ways—from automating tasks to monitoring workers to reshaping entire industries. The anxiety is real, and so are the opportunities.

What jobs are most exposed? What rights do workers have? How can we ensure the transition benefits everyone, not just those at the top?

### 💰 Economic Impact

AI generates enormous value—but for whom? The benefits of AI are not distributed equally. Large tech companies with vast data resources and computational power have significant advantages, while smaller businesses and workers may struggle to capture their share.

Who wins and who loses in the AI economy? What policies can ensure broader prosperity?

### 🗳️ Democracy and Society

AI doesn't just affect individuals—it shapes our collective life. From the algorithms that curate our news feeds to deepfakes that erode trust, AI is transforming the information environment that democracy depends on.

How do we govern systems that increasingly govern us? How do we maintain democratic accountability?

### 👁️ Surveillance and Privacy

AI supercharges surveillance capabilities, enabling monitoring at a scale and precision previously impossible. Biometric identification, behavioral prediction, and pervasive tracking raise fundamental questions about freedom and privacy.

What are the limits? What protections exist? What can you do?

## These Issues Need Your Voice

The decisions being made now about AI will shape society for decades to come. They're too important to be left to technologists, corporations, or governments alone.

Whether you're a worker concerned about automation, a citizen worried about surveillance, or simply someone who wants to understand what's happening—your perspective matters.
