# AI in Education

Whether you're a parent, student, or teacher, AI is increasingly present in educational settings. Understanding how it works—and your rights—helps you navigate this changing landscape.

## How AI Is Used in Schools

AI appears in education in many forms:

### Adaptive Learning Platforms
Software that adjusts difficulty and content based on how a student performs. Examples include personalized math tutors, reading programs, and language learning apps.

### Plagiarism Detection
Tools like Turnitin that check student work against databases of existing content, including AI-generated text detection.

### Grading Assistance
AI that helps teachers grade essays, provide feedback, or assess multiple-choice tests automatically.

### Student Monitoring
Systems that track attendance, engagement, behavior, or screen activity—especially common during remote learning.

### ChatGPT and Large Language Models
Students using AI assistants for research, writing help, or homework—raising questions about learning and academic integrity.

### Proctoring Software
AI that monitors students during online exams, watching for signs of cheating through webcam analysis.

## Benefits and Risks

### The Benefits
- **Personalization**: AI can adapt to each student's pace and learning style
- **Immediate feedback**: Students can learn from mistakes in real-time
- **Teacher support**: Automation of routine tasks frees teachers for human connection
- **Accessibility**: AI can help students with disabilities through transcription, translation, or adapted content

### The Risks
- **Surveillance concerns**: Constant monitoring can create anxiety and harm learning
- **Dependency**: Over-reliance on AI may reduce critical thinking and problem-solving skills
- **Bias**: AI trained on limited data may not serve all students equally
- **Privacy**: Student data collection raises questions about who has access and for how long
- **Accuracy**: AI plagiarism detectors have shown high false-positive rates, wrongly accusing students

## EU AI Act: Education AI Is High-Risk

Under the EU AI Act (Article 6, Annex III), AI systems used in education are classified as **high-risk**. This includes:

- AI that determines access to education or training
- AI that evaluates learning outcomes
- AI that assesses the appropriate level of education for an individual
- AI used to monitor student behavior during exams

### What This Means

High-risk classification requires:

✓ **Transparency**: Schools must inform you when high-risk AI is used

✓ **Human oversight**: AI decisions must have human review, especially for significant outcomes

✓ **Bias testing**: Systems must be tested for discriminatory effects

✓ **Documentation**: Schools should be able to explain how systems work

✓ **Accuracy requirements**: Systems must meet quality standards

## For Parents: Questions to Ask Your Child's School

If your child's school uses AI, consider asking:

**About transparency:**
- What AI or automated systems are used with my child?
- What data is collected, and how long is it kept?
- Who has access to this information?

**About decisions:**
- Are any AI systems used to assess, grade, or make decisions about my child?
- How can I see what the system has recorded about my child?
- Can I opt out of certain systems?

**About oversight:**
- Is there human review of AI-assisted assessments?
- How are teachers trained to use these systems responsibly?
- What happens if the system makes a mistake?

**About safety:**
- How is my child's data protected?
- Is monitoring software used on school devices at home?
- What are the school's policies on AI-generated content?

## For Teachers: Responsible AI Use Principles

If you're an educator using AI tools:

**Be transparent**
- Tell students when AI is used in assessment or monitoring
- Explain how the tools work at an age-appropriate level
- Discuss the limitations of AI with students

**Maintain oversight**
- Never let AI make final decisions about students without review
- Check AI feedback for accuracy, especially for subjective work
- Be aware of potential bias in AI assessments

**Protect students**
- Consider the impact of surveillance on student wellbeing
- Advocate for minimal data collection
- Question whether monitoring tools are truly necessary

**Model good practice**
- Help students understand when AI use is appropriate
- Teach critical evaluation of AI-generated content
- Create space for human connection that AI cannot replace

## For Students: Your Rights and Responsibilities

### Your Rights

✓ **Right to know**: You should be told when AI is used in grading, monitoring, or decisions about you

✓ **Right to explanation**: If AI affects your grade or academic standing, you can ask how

✓ **Right to human review**: For significant academic decisions, a human should be involved

✓ **Right to access**: You can ask to see data collected about you

✓ **Right to challenge**: If you believe AI has treated you unfairly, you can appeal

### Academic Integrity Guidance

Using AI tools raises new questions about academic honesty:

- **Know your school's policy**: Rules about AI use vary widely—understand what's allowed
- **Cite AI assistance**: If you use AI for research or drafting, be transparent about it
- **Don't submit AI work as your own**: Passing off AI-generated content as original is dishonest
- **Develop your own skills**: AI should support your learning, not replace it
- **Be aware of detection**: AI plagiarism detectors are improving, and faculty are adapting

If you're unsure whether AI use is appropriate for an assignment, ask your teacher before submitting.

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 **No disclosure**: Schools using AI without informing parents or students

🚩 **Constant surveillance**: Monitoring that extends beyond what's necessary for education

🚩 **AI-only decisions**: Important outcomes determined without human review

🚩 **Unexplained changes**: Sudden shifts in grades or placement without clear reasoning

🚩 **Data overreach**: Collection of sensitive information beyond educational needs

🚩 **No appeal process**: No way to challenge AI-influenced decisions

🚩 **Emotion detection**: AI claiming to assess student emotions or engagement (banned in many contexts)

## What You Can Do

**For parents:**
- Request your school's AI and data policies
- Ask specific questions at parent-teacher meetings
- Connect with other parents to advocate for transparency
- Contact your data protection authority if concerns aren't addressed

**For teachers:**
- Discuss AI policies with your administration
- Advocate for teacher input on technology decisions
- Share concerns through professional associations
- Stay informed about evolving regulations

**For students:**
- Know your rights and don't be afraid to ask questions
- Keep records if you believe you've been treated unfairly
- Support classmates who raise concerns
- Engage with school governance on technology issues
