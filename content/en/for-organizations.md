# AI Guidance for Organizations

**Responsible AI isn't just ethical—it's good business.** Organizations that implement AI thoughtfully build trust with customers, employees, and regulators. They reduce legal risk, avoid costly mistakes, and position themselves for long-term success in a regulated environment.

Whether you're a small business using AI tools, a school deploying educational technology, or a government agency serving citizens, this guide will help you navigate your responsibilities under the EU AI Act.

## Ethics and Compliance: Two Sides of the Same Coin

Some organizations treat ethical AI and regulatory compliance as separate concerns—one for the philosophy department, one for the lawyers. **That's a mistake.**

The EU AI Act is built on ethical foundations:

- **Transparency** requirements exist because people deserve to know when AI affects them
- **Human oversight** mandates exist because algorithms shouldn't make life-changing decisions alone
- **Bias testing** requirements exist because AI shouldn't discriminate

When you build ethical AI systems, you're already doing most of what compliance requires. And when you follow compliance requirements, you're implementing the practical aspects of AI ethics.

**The practical upshot:** Don't have separate "ethics" and "compliance" initiatives. Build one program that does both.

## Common Questions

### "We're small—does the EU AI Act even apply to us?"

Yes, if you're deploying AI systems that affect EU residents. Size doesn't exempt you from the rules, though your obligations scale with your risk level. Most SMEs using standard AI tools have minimal obligations.

### "We just use tools—we're not building AI."

That's the situation for most organizations. You still have responsibilities, but they're less extensive than for AI developers. The key is knowing which tools you're using and understanding their risk levels.

### "This seems complicated. Where do we start?"

Start with an inventory. What AI tools and systems does your organization use? That simple question—answered honestly—gives you the foundation for everything else.
