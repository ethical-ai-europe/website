# Deploy AI Confidently and Responsibly

**AI can help your business compete, innovate, and serve customers better.** But with opportunity comes responsibility. The EU AI Act creates clear rules—and understanding them gives you a competitive advantage.

This guide cuts through the complexity. Whether you're using AI tools, deploying AI in customer-facing applications, or building AI into your products, you'll find practical guidance here.

## Your Concerns Are Valid

### "What are my legal obligations?"
Depending on how you use AI, your obligations range from minimal to significant. We'll help you understand where you stand.

### "How do I know if my AI use is high-risk?"
The EU AI Act uses a risk-based approach. Most SMEs have minimal obligations, but some uses—like AI in hiring—require full compliance.

### "We want to use AI but don't have a legal team."
You don't need one for most AI uses. Our practical guides explain what you need to do in plain language.

### "What's the timeline for compliance?"
The EU AI Act is phased in over several years, but some requirements are already in effect. We'll show you what's required when.

## 3 Steps to Start Today

### 1. Create an AI Inventory
Make a simple list: What AI tools and systems does your business use? For each one, note the purpose, vendor, and data involved.

### 2. Classify Your Risk Levels
For each AI system, ask: Does it make or influence significant decisions about people? Is it in a high-risk sector like employment or credit? Use our SME Guide to determine your risk level.

### 3. Address the Obvious Gaps
If you're using AI in customer communications, are you disclosing it? If you're using AI in hiring, is there human oversight? Start with the most visible obligations.

## Why This Matters for Your Business

**The EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive AI regulation.** It applies to any organization deploying AI systems that affect EU residents—regardless of where the business is located.

For most SMEs using common AI tools, obligations are minimal. But if you're using AI in hiring, credit decisions, or other high-impact areas, you need to take compliance seriously.

The good news: **The requirements aren't mysterious.** They come down to knowing what you're using, being transparent about it, keeping humans in the loop, and documenting your approach.

Start now, start simple, and build from there. **Early preparation beats last-minute scrambles.**
