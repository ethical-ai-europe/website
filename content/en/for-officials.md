# Implement AI That Serves All Citizens

**When government uses AI, the stakes are higher.** Citizens can't choose a different provider. Public services affect fundamental rights. And public trust—once broken—is hard to rebuild.

This guide helps public officials and policymakers deploy AI responsibly. You face heightened obligations under the EU AI Act—and that's appropriate. When algorithms make decisions about benefits, services, or enforcement, they must be fair, transparent, and accountable.

---

## Your Responsibilities

### Comply with AI Act as Deployers
Public sector organizations are "deployers" under the EU AI Act and must meet specific requirements—especially for high-risk AI.

### Protect Citizen Rights
Citizens have the right to know when AI affects their cases, to receive explanations, and to access human review.

### Make Informed Policy Decisions
Understanding AI's capabilities and limitations is essential for sound policy in the AI era.

### Build Public Trust
Transparent, accountable AI use strengthens democratic legitimacy. Opaque systems erode it.

## Quick Reference: AI Classification

| Classification | Description | Public Sector Examples | Key Requirements |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Prohibited** | Banned entirely | Social scoring, most real-time biometric ID | Do not use |
| **High Risk** | Strict requirements | Benefits eligibility, fraud detection, law enforcement | Full compliance: risk management, documentation, oversight, registration |
| **Limited Risk** | Transparency required | Chatbots on government websites | Disclosure to users |
| **Minimal Risk** | Best practices | Internal productivity tools | No specific obligations |

---

## Upcoming Compliance Deadlines

| Date | What's Required |
|------|-----------------|
| **February 2025** | Prohibited AI practices banned |
| **August 2025** | General-purpose AI rules apply |
| **August 2026** | Most high-risk AI requirements apply |
| **August 2027** | Full application to all AI systems |

### Priority Actions by Timeline

**Now → February 2025**
- Complete AI inventory across all departments
- Identify any prohibited uses (stop immediately)
- Begin risk classification

**February 2025 → August 2025**
- Confirm no prohibited practices in use
- Complete risk classification
- Begin high-risk compliance for critical systems

**August 2025 → August 2026**
- Complete high-risk compliance preparation
- Establish governance structures
- Implement training programs
- Prepare registration for high-risk systems

**August 2026 onwards**
- Full compliance required for high-risk AI
- Ongoing monitoring and review
- Regular compliance audits
- Public register entries maintained

## 3 Steps to Start Now

### 1. Inventory Your AI
Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all AI systems in use across your organization. You can't manage what you don't know about.

### 2. Identify Prohibited Uses
Review your inventory for any uses that fall under the EU AI Act's prohibited categories. If found, stop them immediately.

### 3. Classify Risk Levels
For each AI system, determine whether it's high-risk, limited risk, or minimal risk. High-risk systems need priority attention.

## Why This Matters

**Public sector AI affects people who have no choice.** Unlike commercial services, citizens can't take their business elsewhere if government AI fails them. That creates a special obligation for fairness and accountability.

The EU AI Act recognizes this. Public sector organizations face heightened requirements because:

- **Power asymmetry:** Government has coercive power private entities lack
- **Equal treatment:** Government must treat all citizens fairly
- **Fundamental rights:** Government decisions often affect protected rights
- **Democratic accountability:** Citizens have the right to understand how they're governed

**Responsible AI deployment isn't just about compliance—it's about maintaining the public trust that democratic governance requires.**

Done well, AI can make government more efficient, more consistent, and more accessible. Done poorly, it can undermine the very legitimacy of public institutions.

The choice is yours to make.
