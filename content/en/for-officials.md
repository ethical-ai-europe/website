# Implement AI That Serves All Citizens

**When government uses AI, the stakes are higher.** Citizens can't choose a different provider. Public services affect fundamental rights. And public trust—once broken—is hard to rebuild.

This guide helps public officials and policymakers deploy AI responsibly. You face heightened obligations under the EU AI Act—and that's appropriate. When algorithms make decisions about benefits, services, or enforcement, they must be fair, transparent, and accountable.

---

## Your Responsibilities

### Comply with AI Act as Deployers
Public sector organizations are "deployers" under the EU AI Act and must meet specific requirements—especially for high-risk AI.

### Protect Citizen Rights
Citizens have the right to know when AI affects their cases, to receive explanations, and to access human review.

### Make Informed Policy Decisions
Understanding AI's capabilities and limitations is essential for sound policy in the AI era.

### Build Public Trust
Transparent, accountable AI use strengthens democratic legitimacy. Opaque systems erode it.

## Policy Tools for Implementation

### Fundamental Rights and Algorithmic Impact Assessments
Before deploying high-risk AI, public organisations should conduct a **Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA)**. This involves:
- Identifying which fundamental rights the system could affect
- Assessing the likelihood and severity of adverse impacts
- Documenting mitigation measures
- Consulting affected communities where appropriate

The EU AI Act requires deployers of high-risk AI in public services to carry out a FRIA before deployment.

### Regulatory Sandboxes
The EU AI Act establishes **AI regulatory sandboxes** — controlled environments where organisations can test AI systems under supervision before full deployment. These allow:
- Testing in real conditions with regulatory oversight
- Identifying compliance issues early
- Developing evidence for risk assessments
- Demonstrating commitment to responsible deployment

Contact your national AI authority to understand sandbox availability in your jurisdiction.

### Technical Standards
Several European and international standards bodies are developing AI standards:
- **CEN/CENELEC** (European standards) — developing standards aligned with the EU AI Act
- **ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42** — international AI standards including risk management and bias testing
- **ENISA** (EU Agency for Cybersecurity) — guidance on AI security

### Governance Principles

## Inter-Agency Coordination

### Sharing Governance Burden
Few public bodies have all the expertise needed for responsible AI deployment in-house. Effective governance often requires coordination:

**Within your organisation:**
- Designate an AI coordination function (not necessarily a separate team—this can be a working group)
- Ensure legal, IT, service delivery, and communications teams are all involved in AI decisions
- Create an escalation path for novel or high-risk deployment decisions

**Across government:**
- Share AI impact assessments and risk registers with central digital or AI authorities
- Coordinate procurement requirements to benefit from collective bargaining power and shared standards
- Join cross-government AI working groups if available in your jurisdiction

**With external bodies:**
- Engage with your national data protection authority on compliance questions
- Participate in consultations on national AI strategies
- Report significant AI-related incidents to relevant authorities

### Central Coordination Resources
Many EU member states are establishing national AI strategies and coordination mechanisms. Check your government's digital or technology ministry for guidance specific to your jurisdiction.

## 3 Steps to Start Now

### 1. Inventory Your AI
Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all AI systems in use across your organization. You can't manage what you don't know about.

### 2. Identify Prohibited Uses
Review your inventory for any uses that fall under the EU AI Act's prohibited categories. If found, stop them immediately.

### 3. Classify Risk Levels
For each AI system, determine whether it's high-risk, limited risk, or minimal risk. High-risk systems need priority attention.

## Why This Matters

**Public sector AI affects people who have no choice.** Unlike commercial services, citizens can't take their business elsewhere if government AI fails them. That creates a special obligation for fairness and accountability.

The EU AI Act recognizes this. Public sector organizations face heightened requirements because:

- **Power asymmetry:** Government has coercive power private entities lack
- **Equal treatment:** Government must treat all citizens fairly
- **Fundamental rights:** Government decisions often affect protected rights
- **Democratic accountability:** Citizens have the right to understand how they're governed

**Responsible AI deployment isn't just about compliance—it's about maintaining the public trust that democratic governance requires.**

Done well, AI can make government more efficient, more consistent, and more accessible. Done poorly, it can undermine the very legitimacy of public institutions.

The choice is yours to make.
