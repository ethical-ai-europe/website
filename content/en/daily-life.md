# AI in Your Daily Life

**AI is already part of your daily life—often in ways you don't see.** When your child uses an adaptive learning app, when a doctor reviews your scan, when you apply for a job online, or when you interact with government services, artificial intelligence may be working behind the scenes.

This isn't science fiction. It's happening now, and you have rights.

## Where AI Touches Your Life

AI is increasingly used in contexts that matter most. We've created guides for four key areas:

### 🎓 Education
From adaptive learning platforms to plagiarism detection, AI is transforming how students learn and how teachers teach. Parents, students, and educators all need to understand what's happening.

### 🏥 Healthcare
AI assists with diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and administrative decisions. As a patient, you deserve to know when AI is involved in your care.

### 💼 Hiring & Recruitment
AI screens resumes, analyzes video interviews, and ranks candidates. Job seekers and HR professionals alike need to understand these systems.

### 🏛️ Public Services
Government agencies use AI for benefits eligibility, fraud detection, and resource allocation. These decisions can be life-changing.

## Questions to Ask in Any Context

When you suspect AI is involved in decisions that affect you, start with these questions:

**1. "Was AI or an automated system involved in this decision?"**
You have the right to know. Ask directly.

**2. "How did the system reach this conclusion?"**
You're entitled to an explanation, not just a result.

**3. "Can a human review this decision?"**
For significant decisions, you can request human oversight.

**4. "What data was used, and was it accurate?"**
Decisions are only as good as the data they're based on.

**5. "How can I challenge this if I disagree?"**
Know your options for appeal or complaint.

## Your Rights Apply Everywhere

Whether you're a student, patient, job seeker, or citizen interacting with government:

✓ **You have the right to know** when AI is being used in decisions about you

✓ **You have the right to explanation** of how decisions are made

✓ **You have the right to human review** for significant decisions

✓ **You have the right to object** if you believe you've been treated unfairly

The EU AI Act and GDPR work together to protect you in all these contexts. You don't need to be a legal expert—just know that the law is on your side.

## Empowering, Not Alarming

AI brings both benefits and risks. Our goal isn't to scare you away from these systems, but to help you:

- **Understand** what's happening and why
- **Ask the right questions** when AI affects you
- **Know your rights** and how to exercise them
- **Make informed choices** about the systems in your life

Knowledge is power. Let's explore these contexts together.
