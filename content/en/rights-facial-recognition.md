# Facial Recognition: Where It's Banned

Facial recognition is one of the most regulated AI technologies in Europe. The EU AI Act imposes strict bans and limits on how it can be used—because your face shouldn't be a tracking device.

## Understanding Facial Recognition

Not all face-related technology works the same way. Here's what you need to know:

### Types of Facial Recognition

**Real-time identification** - Cameras that identify you as you walk by, comparing your face to a database in the moment. *This is what's largely banned.*

**Post-facto identification** - Using footage after an event to identify people. *Heavily restricted, with exceptions for serious crimes.*

**Verification (1-to-1)** - Confirming you are who you claim to be, like unlocking your phone with your face. *Generally allowed with consent.*

**Detection (not recognition)** - Simply detecting that a face is present, without identifying who it belongs to. *Lower risk, but still regulated.*

## What the EU AI Act Prohibits

### ❌ Banned Uses

The following are **prohibited** across the European Union:

**Real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces**
Law enforcement cannot use AI to identify people in real-time through public cameras. There are very narrow exceptions for:
- Searching for missing persons or trafficking victims
- Preventing immediate terrorist threats
- Locating suspects of serious crimes

Even these exceptions require judicial or independent authorization.

**Scraping facial images**
Building facial recognition databases by scraping photos from the internet or CCTV footage is banned. Companies like Clearview AI cannot legally operate this way in Europe.

**Emotion recognition in certain contexts**
AI that claims to detect emotions from facial expressions is banned in workplaces and schools.

**Biometric categorization by sensitive attributes**
AI that categorizes people by race, religion, political beliefs, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics based on biometric data is prohibited.

### ⚠️ Restricted Uses

These require strict oversight:

**Post-event law enforcement use** - Only for investigating serious crimes, with proper authorization

**Access control in sensitive facilities** - Allowed with appropriate safeguards

**Identity verification for required services** - Such as banking verification, with consent

## Private Companies: What They Can and Can't Do

### Generally Not Allowed

- Tracking customers through stores using facial recognition
- Building profiles of visitors without explicit consent
- Using emotion detection on customers or employees
- Sharing biometric data with third parties

### May Be Allowed with Proper Consent

- Voluntary access control (like unlocking your own phone)
- Opt-in verification services
- Security in limited, high-risk environments

**Key point:** Even where allowed, you must give explicit, informed consent for a company to use your biometric data. A sign saying "facial recognition in use" is not enough—you must have a real choice.

## Know Your Rights

### Your Rights in Public Spaces

**Right to know** - Public authorities using facial recognition must be transparent about it

**Right to object** - You can object to processing of your biometric data

**Right to remedies** - If your rights are violated, you can file complaints and seek damages

### Your Rights with Private Companies

**Right to refuse** - You cannot be denied service for refusing facial recognition if alternatives exist

**Right to deletion** - You can request your biometric data be deleted

**Right to access** - You can ask what biometric data is held about you

## What You Can Do

### If You Encounter Facial Recognition

**Ask questions:**
- What is this system being used for?
- Is it mandatory?
- What happens to my data?
- How long is it stored?

**Know your options:**
- Request alternative methods (ID card, PIN, attendant verification)
- File a complaint if consent wasn't properly obtained

### If You're Concerned About Public Surveillance

**Check local policies** - Your municipality should publish information about any surveillance systems in use

**Contact your data protection authority** - They can investigate unlawful surveillance

**Support civil society organizations** - Groups working on digital rights can amplify your concerns

## Country Variations

While the EU AI Act sets baseline rules across Europe, some countries go further:

**Some countries have:**
- Stricter bans on certain uses
- More active enforcement
- Additional consent requirements

**What this means for you:**
- Check your national data protection authority's guidance
- Rules may be stricter where you live
- The EU rules are the minimum protection you have

## Quick Reference

- **Real-time public identification** → ❌ Banned (limited exceptions)
- **Scraping faces from internet/CCTV** → ❌ Banned
- **Emotion detection at work/school** → ❌ Banned
- **Categorization by race, religion, etc.** → ❌ Banned
- **Post-event law enforcement** → ⚠️ Restricted
- **Voluntary phone/device unlock** → ✅ Allowed with consent
- **Building access with consent** → ✅ Allowed with consent
