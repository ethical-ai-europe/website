# Shape How the Next Generation Learns with AI

**You're on the front lines of the AI revolution in education.** Every day, you make decisions about how technology shapes young minds. This guide helps you navigate AI responsibly—protecting students while embracing innovation.

AI in education isn't just a technical question. It's a pedagogical one, an ethical one, and increasingly, a legal one.

---

## Your Concerns Are Valid

### "How do I use AI responsibly in teaching?"
You want to leverage AI's potential without compromising learning outcomes or student wellbeing.

### "What about ChatGPT and academic integrity?"
Generative AI is transforming how students work. You need practical approaches that focus on learning, not just detection.

### "What tools are safe to use with students?"
With vendors making big promises, you need to know what questions to ask and what red flags to watch for.

### "What are my legal obligations?"
As an educator, you have responsibilities under the EU AI Act—especially since education AI is classified as high-risk.

## 3 Steps for Your Classroom

### 1. Audit Your Current AI Use
Make a list of all AI-powered tools you're using with students—from learning platforms to plagiarism detection. For each one, ask: Do students and parents know? What data is collected?

### 2. Rethink One Assessment
Choose one assignment and redesign it to work *with* the reality of AI tools. Focus on process, personal reflection, or in-class components rather than just detecting AI use.

### 3. Start One Conversation
Bring up AI ethics with your students. What do they think about these tools? What concerns do they have? Their perspective may surprise you.

### 📖 AI Literacy: Frameworks and Teaching Approaches

Teaching students to think critically about AI is increasingly considered a core educational competency. Here are some practical approaches:

**Understand before you use:** Before introducing AI tools, help students understand what they are—statistical systems trained on data, not oracles or intelligence. Demystifying AI reduces both uncritical adoption and unfounded fear.

**Process-centred assessment:** Focus on the learning process, not just outputs. Ask students to document their reasoning, revisions, and sources—making it easier to assess genuine learning regardless of which tools they use.

**Discuss the model:** For LLM-based tools, discuss with students how language models work, what hallucination means, and why outputs must be verified. This builds critical evaluation skills.

**Use the EU AI Act as a teaching case:** The regulation itself is excellent curriculum material—it raises questions about how we define risk, who is protected, what transparency means, and who should be accountable.

**Framework resources to explore:**
- UNESCO's AI Competency Framework for Students
- The European Commission's DigComp framework (includes AI literacy)
- Council of Europe guidance on AI and education

### ⚖️ Ethical Considerations When Using AI in Teaching

Using AI tools in your classroom raises real ethical questions worth thinking through:

**Transparency with students:** Are students aware when AI tools are involved in shaping their learning experience or assessments? Transparency is both ethically important and a legal requirement for certain systems.

**Equity and access:** Not all students have equal access to AI tools at home. Policies that require AI-assisted work may disadvantage students without home access.

**Data collection:** Many AI educational tools collect detailed data on student behaviour—reading speed, time on task, responses to questions. Ask vendors what data is collected, who owns it, and how long it is kept.

**Autonomy and critical thinking:** There is a reasonable concern that heavy AI integration can reduce the productive struggle that builds real understanding. Balance is important.

**Student wellbeing:** Monitoring and surveillance tools (attention tracking, emotion recognition) raise particular concerns. Some forms are restricted or prohibited under European law.

### 📚 Resources for Educators

**Discussion prompts for the classroom:**
- "If an algorithm decides who gets into a university programme, what should it consider? What should it never consider?"
- "A company claims their AI tool is fair. What evidence would you need to believe them?"
- "Who should be responsible when an AI system makes a mistake that harms someone?"

**Recommended reading:**
- The EU AI Act (European Commission official text and summaries)
- UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI (2021)
- "The Alignment Problem" by Brian Christian (accessible introduction to AI challenges)
- AlgorithmWatch reports on AI in public life

## Why This Matters for You

**Education AI is classified as high-risk under the EU AI Act.** When AI systems determine access to education, evaluate learning outcomes, or assess students, they must meet strict requirements for transparency, fairness, and human oversight.

As an educator, you're in a unique position. You can:

- **Protect students** by asking the right questions before tools are adopted
- **Model responsible AI use** by being transparent about how you use these tools
- **Advocate for better practices** within your institution
- **Prepare students** for a world where AI literacy is essential

The decisions you make today shape how the next generation understands and interacts with AI. That's both a responsibility and an opportunity.
