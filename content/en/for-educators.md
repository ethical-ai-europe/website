## 3 Steps for Your Classroom

### 1. Audit Your Current AI Use
Make a list of all AI-powered tools you're using with students—from learning platforms to plagiarism detection. For each one, ask: Do students and parents know? What data is collected?

### 2. Rethink One Assessment
Choose one assignment and redesign it to work *with* the reality of AI tools. Focus on process, personal reflection, or in-class components rather than just detecting AI use.

### 3. Start One Conversation
Bring up AI ethics with your students. What do they think about these tools? What concerns do they have? Their perspective may surprise you.

## Why This Matters for You

**Education AI is classified as high-risk under the EU AI Act.** When AI systems determine access to education, evaluate learning outcomes, or assess students, they must meet strict requirements for transparency, fairness, and human oversight.

As an educator, you're in a unique position. You can:

- **Protect students** by asking the right questions before tools are adopted
- **Model responsible AI use** by being transparent about how you use these tools
- **Advocate for better practices** within your institution
- **Prepare students** for a world where AI literacy is essential

The decisions you make today shape how the next generation understands and interacts with AI. That's both a responsibility and an opportunity.
