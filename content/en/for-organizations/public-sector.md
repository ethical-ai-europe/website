# AI in the Public Sector

**When government uses AI, the stakes are higher.** Citizens can't choose a different provider. Public services affect fundamental rights. And public trust—once broken—is hard to rebuild.

This guide helps government officials, public administrators, and policymakers deploy AI responsibly. The public sector faces heightened obligations under the EU AI Act, and rightly so: when algorithms make decisions about benefits, services, or enforcement, they must be fair, transparent, and accountable.

---

## Why Public Sector AI Faces Higher Standards

Public sector AI carries unique responsibilities:

- **No alternative provider:** Citizens can't take their business elsewhere if government AI fails them
- **Power asymmetry:** Government has coercive power that private entities lack
- **Equal treatment obligations:** Government must treat all citizens fairly
- **Fundamental rights:** Government decisions often affect protected rights
- **Democratic accountability:** Citizens have the right to understand how they're governed
- **Public trust:** Government credibility depends on fair, transparent processes

The EU AI Act recognizes this. Many public sector AI applications are classified as **high-risk** or even **prohibited**.

---

## Prohibited Uses: Hard Lines

Certain AI applications are banned entirely. Public sector organizations must be especially vigilant:

### ❌ Social Scoring
AI systems that evaluate people based on social behavior or personality characteristics to determine access to public services or treatment by public authorities.

**This includes:** Systems that aggregate data about citizen behavior to create scores affecting service access, even if not called "social scoring."

### ❌ Real-Time Biometric Identification in Public Spaces
Live facial recognition or other biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces is prohibited, with very narrow exceptions:
- Targeted search for specific crime victims (including missing children)
- Prevention of specific imminent terrorist threats
- Location of suspects in serious crimes

**Even exceptions require:** Judicial or independent administrative authorization, strict necessity assessment, and proportionality evaluation.

### ❌ Predictive Policing Based on Profiling
AI systems that predict criminal behavior based solely on profiling, personality traits, or residence—without reference to objective, verifiable facts linked to criminal activity.

### ❌ Emotion Recognition in Certain Contexts
Emotion recognition in workplaces and educational institutions is prohibited, except for safety or medical purposes.

### ❌ Biometric Categorization Using Sensitive Attributes
AI systems that categorize individuals based on biometric data to infer race, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, sexual orientation, or health status.

## Framework for Responsible Public Sector AI

When considering any AI deployment, work through this framework:

### 1. Necessity
**Question:** Is AI actually needed to achieve the public interest objective?

- What problem are you trying to solve?
- Can it be solved without AI?
- What's the evidence that AI will perform better than alternatives?
- Have you considered non-technical solutions?

**Guidance:** AI should solve real problems, not create solutions in search of problems. Start with the policy objective, not the technology.

### 2. Proportionality
**Question:** Is AI the least invasive means to achieve the objective?

- Does the AI use go beyond what's necessary?
- Could less data-intensive or less impactful approaches work?
- Is the scope appropriately limited?
- Have you considered less intrusive alternatives?

**Guidance:** More powerful AI isn't always better. Use the minimum capability needed.

### 3. Transparency
**Question:** Can citizens understand how the system works and how it affects them?

- Can you explain the system in plain language?
- Will affected individuals be told when AI is used in their case?
- Is documentation publicly accessible?
- Can citizens understand why they received a particular outcome?

**Guidance:** Citizens have the right to understand how they're governed. If you can't explain it, reconsider deploying it.

### 4. Accountability
**Question:** Who is responsible when something goes wrong?

- Is there a clear chain of responsibility?
- Who makes the final decision (a human, not AI)?
- What happens when errors occur?
- How are systemic problems identified and corrected?

**Guidance:** Accountability can't be delegated to an algorithm. A human must be responsible.

### 5. Redress
**Question:** How can citizens challenge AI-influenced decisions?

- Can individuals request human review?
- Is there an appeals process?
- Do citizens know their rights?
- Are redress mechanisms accessible to all, not just the technically sophisticated?

**Guidance:** The right to challenge government decisions is fundamental. AI can't be a black box that citizens can't contest.

## Procurement Guidance

When purchasing AI systems, require the following from vendors:

### Compliance Documentation
- EU AI Act risk classification determination
- Conformity assessment documentation (for high-risk systems)
- Technical documentation meeting AI Act requirements
- Evidence of CE marking where applicable

### Fairness and Bias
- Bias testing results across relevant demographic groups
- Information about training data diversity
- Ongoing monitoring commitments
- Performance data disaggregated by affected groups

### Transparency and Explainability
- Plain-language system description
- Explanation of decision factors
- User-facing explanations suitable for citizens
- Documentation in accessible formats

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance documentation
- Data processing agreements
- Security certifications
- Breach notification procedures

### Accountability and Support
- Clear liability terms
- Error handling procedures
- Performance guarantees
- Ongoing support commitments
- Exit strategy—what happens if you switch vendors?

### Contract Terms to Include
- Right to audit AI systems
- Requirements for ongoing bias monitoring
- Transparency about significant system changes
- Data portability and deletion requirements

---

## Public Register Requirements

The EU AI Act requires that high-risk AI systems deployed by public authorities be registered in an EU database before deployment.

### What Must Be Registered
- Description of the AI system
- Intended purpose
- Status of the system
- Contact information
- Risk management measures

### When to Register
- Before putting the system into service
- Updates required for significant changes

### Public Access
Citizens will be able to access this register to understand what AI systems are being used by public authorities.

**This is an opportunity, not just an obligation.** Proactive transparency about AI use can build public trust.

## Human Oversight Implementation

For high-risk public sector AI, human oversight isn't optional—it's mandatory. Here's how to implement it effectively:

### Meaningful Oversight
- Humans must be able to understand AI outputs
- Decision-makers must be trained on system limitations
- Overriding AI should be genuinely possible, not just theoretical
- Time and resources must be allocated for human review

### Avoid "Automation Bias"
Research shows humans tend to defer to AI recommendations. Counter this by:
- Training staff to critically evaluate AI outputs
- Requiring independent judgment before viewing AI recommendations
- Tracking override rates and investigating if too low
- Creating incentives for thoughtful review, not rubber-stamping

### Clear Procedures
Document:
- Who reviews AI outputs before decisions are made?
- Under what circumstances should AI be overridden?
- How are overrides recorded and reviewed?
- How is the AI updated based on override patterns?

### Capacity
Ensure:
- Sufficient staff to review AI-influenced decisions
- Realistic workloads that allow genuine review
- Training on AI system capabilities and limitations
- Support for staff who identify AI errors

## Case Studies

### 🟢 Good Practice: Transparent Benefits Processing

A social services agency deployed AI to accelerate benefits processing. They:
- Published a plain-language description of the AI system
- Ensured caseworkers reviewed AI recommendations before decisions
- Tracked decision patterns by demographic group to catch bias
- Provided clear appeals process referencing AI involvement
- Regularly audited system performance and published results

**Result:** Faster processing with maintained fairness and citizen trust.

### 🔴 Problem Case: Opaque Fraud Detection

A tax authority deployed AI fraud detection without adequate oversight:
- Citizens weren't told AI flagged their returns
- No explanation provided for fraud determinations
- Limited ability to challenge AI classifications
- Bias in fraud predictions went undetected for years
- Disproportionate impact on certain communities

**Result:** Wrongful accusations, broken trust, legal action, and program suspension.

### 🟢 Good Practice: Public Registry for Police AI

A police department choosing to use AI for resource allocation:
- Published all AI tools in use on a public website
- Provided plain-language descriptions of each system
- Explained what data is used and how
- Held public meetings to discuss AI deployment
- Established civilian oversight board for AI decisions

**Result:** Maintained community trust while using AI effectively.

### 🔴 Problem Case: Educational AI Without Consent

A school district deployed AI to predict student outcomes:
- Parents weren't informed about AI profiling
- Predictions influenced tracking and opportunity access
- No mechanism for students/parents to challenge classifications
- Bias in predictions reinforced existing inequalities
- Media exposure caused significant backlash

**Result:** Program cancelled, trust damaged, legal scrutiny.
