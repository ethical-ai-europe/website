# AI Guidance for Educators & Schools

**AI in education isn't just a technical decision—it's a choice about how we shape young minds.** When algorithms help determine what students learn, how they're assessed, or what opportunities they access, we need to apply special care.

This guide helps teachers, school administrators, and education policymakers navigate AI responsibly. It covers both regulatory requirements under the EU AI Act and practical guidance for ethical implementation.

---

## Why Education AI Requires Special Care

Children and students deserve extra protection:

- **Developing minds** are more susceptible to influence
- **Power imbalances** between institutions and students are significant
- **Long-term impacts** of educational decisions shape entire lives
- **Fairness matters more** when opportunities are at stake
- **Data sensitivity** is heightened for minors

The EU AI Act recognizes this. **AI systems used in education are explicitly classified as high-risk** when they:
- Determine access to education or training
- Evaluate learning outcomes
- Assess appropriate levels of education
- Influence educational opportunities

This doesn't mean you can't use AI in education. It means you must use it thoughtfully.

## Framework for Evaluating AI Tools

Before adopting any AI tool, work through these five questions:

### 1. Purpose: What Problem Does It Solve?

- Is there a genuine educational need?
- Is AI the right solution, or are simpler alternatives available?
- What's the expected benefit to students?
- Could this be achieved without AI?

**Red flag:** AI tools searching for problems to solve, rather than addressing clear educational needs.

### 2. Data: What Does It Collect and Where Does It Go?

- What student data is collected?
- Where is the data stored? (EU vs. non-EU)
- How long is it retained?
- Who has access?
- Is it shared with third parties?
- Can data be deleted when requested?

**Red flag:** Vague answers about data handling, or data leaving EU jurisdiction without clear safeguards.

### 3. Bias: Has It Been Tested for Fairness?

- Has the system been tested for bias across different student groups?
- Are there performance differences based on language, disability, socioeconomic background?
- How diverse was the training data?
- What ongoing monitoring exists?

**Red flag:** No bias testing, or dismissive responses to fairness questions.

### 4. Transparency: Can Students and Parents Understand It?

- Can you explain to parents how the AI works?
- Will students understand why they received certain results?
- Is there documentation in accessible language?
- Can decisions be explained, not just announced?

**Red flag:** "Black box" systems that can't be explained to non-technical stakeholders.

### 5. Human Oversight: Who Reviews AI Decisions?

- Do teachers review AI recommendations before they affect students?
- Is there a process to override AI decisions?
- Who is accountable for AI outcomes?
- How do you catch and correct AI errors?

**Red flag:** Fully automated decisions with no human review.

## Policy Template: AI in Your School

Consider developing a school AI policy covering these elements:

### AI Tool Approval Process

- Who can propose new AI tools?
- What evaluation criteria must be met?
- Who approves adoption?
- How are existing tools reviewed?

**Template language:**
> "All AI tools used for educational purposes must be approved by [designated authority] following evaluation against our AI assessment framework. No AI tool shall be used with students until approval is documented."

### Student Data Protection

- Compliance with GDPR and national data protection laws
- Data minimization—collect only what's necessary
- Consent requirements for minors
- Parental notification procedures
- Data retention limits

**Template language:**
> "Student data processed by AI systems shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for the educational purpose. Parents/guardians must be informed of AI data processing, and appropriate consent obtained where required by law."

### Teacher Training Requirements

- Basic AI literacy for all staff
- Specific training for teachers using AI tools
- Understanding of limitations and bias risks
- Ongoing professional development

**Template language:**
> "Staff using AI tools with students must complete approved training covering the tool's function, limitations, and appropriate use. This training must be refreshed [annually/when tools change]."

### Parent Communication

- Notification of AI use in education
- Plain-language explanations of AI systems
- Process for parents to ask questions
- Opt-out provisions where appropriate

**Template language:**
> "Parents/guardians shall be informed when AI systems are used in ways that may affect their child's education or generate records about their child. Information shall be provided in accessible language."

### Student AI Literacy

- Age-appropriate education about AI
- Understanding of AI limitations
- Skills for critical evaluation of AI outputs
- Rights awareness

**Template language:**
> "Students shall receive age-appropriate education about AI systems used in their learning, including how these systems work, their limitations, and students' rights regarding AI-assisted decisions."

## Generative AI in the Classroom

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT present unique challenges for education. Here's practical guidance:

### Academic Integrity: Beyond Detection

"AI detection" tools are unreliable and can produce false positives, unfairly accusing students of misconduct. Instead of trying to catch AI use, consider these approaches:

**Redesign assessments:**
- Focus on process, not just final products
- Include in-class components
- Ask for personal reflection and connection to course discussions
- Use oral examinations or presentations
- Design assignments that require recent/local information

**Teach responsible use:**
- Make expectations explicit
- Discuss when AI assistance is and isn't appropriate
- Help students understand why learning the underlying skills matters
- Treat AI tools like other sources—requiring acknowledgment

**Evaluate understanding:**
- Ask follow-up questions
- Request students explain their reasoning
- Check for understanding in multiple ways
- Focus on demonstrated learning, not polished output

### Teaching WITH AI, Not Just Detecting It

Generative AI can enhance learning when used thoughtfully:

**Appropriate uses:**
- Brainstorming and idea generation
- Explaining concepts in different ways
- Providing practice problems with explanations
- Language support for non-native speakers
- Accessibility accommodations
- Helping students understand feedback

**Uses requiring caution:**
- Research (AI can produce false information)
- Grading or assessment
- Personalization based on sensitive characteristics
- Any use with younger children without supervision

### Age-Appropriate Use Policies

| Age Group | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| **Primary (5-11)** | Teacher-mediated AI use only; no independent student access to chatbots; focus on AI awareness |
| **Lower Secondary (11-14)** | Supervised use with clear guidelines; explicit instruction on limitations; closed-environment tools preferred |
| **Upper Secondary (14-18)** | Guided independent use; critical evaluation skills; responsible use agreements; academic integrity discussions |
| **Post-Secondary (18+)** | Adult-level expectations; clear course policies; discipline-specific guidance; preparation for workplace AI use |

## Questions to Ask Vendors

Before purchasing AI educational tools, require clear answers:

### Compliance Questions
1. How is your product classified under the EU AI Act?
2. What conformity assessments have you completed?
3. Can you provide technical documentation meeting EU AI Act requirements?
4. How do you ensure GDPR compliance for student data?

### Fairness Questions
5. What bias testing has been conducted?
6. Can you share results of fairness evaluations?
7. How diverse was your training data?
8. What ongoing monitoring do you conduct?

### Transparency Questions
9. Can you explain how your AI reaches its outputs in plain language?
10. What documentation is available for parents and students?
11. How do you notify users when AI is being used?

### Data Questions
12. Exactly what student data do you collect?
13. Where is data stored? For how long?
14. Who has access to student data?
15. Is data used for any purpose beyond serving our students?
16. What happens to student data if we stop using your service?

### Accountability Questions
17. Who is responsible if the AI makes errors affecting students?
18. What's your process for handling complaints?
19. How can teachers override AI recommendations?
20. What insurance or liability coverage do you have?

**Vendor won't answer clearly?** That's a red flag. Consider alternatives.
