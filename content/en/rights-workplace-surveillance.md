# AI Surveillance at Work: Your Rights

Your employer may be using AI to monitor your work—but that doesn't mean anything goes. European law sets clear limits on workplace surveillance, and some practices are banned entirely.

## What Counts as AI Surveillance at Work?

AI workplace monitoring comes in many forms. You might encounter:

- **Keystroke and mouse tracking** - Software that records how you use your computer
- **Productivity scoring** - AI that grades your performance based on activity
- **Screen monitoring** - Tools that capture or watch your screen
- **Email and chat analysis** - AI that reads your communications
- **Video surveillance** - Cameras that may use facial recognition or behavior analysis
- **Emotion detection** - Systems that claim to read your mood or engagement
- **Location tracking** - GPS or network-based tracking of your movements
- **Time and attendance AI** - Automated systems that monitor when and how long you work

## What's Allowed, Restricted, and Banned

Here's a clear breakdown of where your rights stand:

### ❌ Prohibited (Banned Under EU AI Act)

These practices are **not allowed** in European workplaces:

- **Emotion recognition in the workplace** - Systems that infer your emotional state, feelings, or intentions while you work
- **Biometric categorization by sensitive attributes** - Systems that categorize you based on race, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics
- **Social scoring by employers** - Systems that rate employees based on social behavior or predicted characteristics

### ⚠️ Restricted (Requires Justification & Safeguards)

These are classified as **high-risk AI systems** and must meet strict requirements:

- **AI-assisted hiring and recruitment** - Must be transparent, tested for bias, and allow human oversight
- **Performance evaluation AI** - Must provide explanations and human review options
- **Promotion and termination decisions** - Cannot be fully automated for significant outcomes
- **Task allocation based on AI** - Must be fair and non-discriminatory

Employers using these systems must:
- Inform you that AI is being used
- Provide access to human decision-makers
- Maintain documentation and conduct regular testing

### ✅ Generally Allowed (With Transparency)

- **Basic time tracking** - Recording work hours
- **Standard productivity tools** - Email, collaboration software, project management
- **Network security monitoring** - For legitimate security purposes
- **Anonymized analytics** - Aggregate data about workplace patterns

Even these require transparency—you should be informed about what data is collected.

## Know the Red Flags

Watch out for these warning signs:

🚩 **No clear policy** - If your employer can't explain what monitoring is in place, that's a problem

🚩 **Constant surveillance** - Being watched every second, including breaks

🚩 **Emotion or mood tracking** - Claims to detect your stress levels, engagement, or feelings

🚩 **No human oversight** - AI making decisions about you with no way to appeal

🚩 **Secret monitoring** - Surveillance you weren't told about

🚩 **Punitive scoring** - Arbitrary productivity scores that affect your job security

## Your Rights in Action

### Step 1: Find Out What's Being Used

You have the right to know. Ask your employer (in writing):
- What monitoring or AI systems are used in the workplace?
- What data is collected about employees?
- How is this data used in decisions about employment, performance, or discipline?
- Who has access to this data?

Under GDPR, your employer must respond within one month.

### Step 2: Review Your Employment Documents

Check your:
- Employment contract
- Employee handbook
- IT and monitoring policies
- Data protection notices

These should disclose monitoring practices. If they don't match what's actually happening, that's a concern.

### Step 3: Document Your Concerns

If you believe your rights are being violated:
- Keep a written record of what you observe
- Save any communications about monitoring
- Note dates and specifics

### Step 4: Take Action

**Talk to HR or management** - Raise concerns formally, in writing

**Contact your works council or union** - They have rights to be consulted on workplace monitoring

**File a complaint** - Your national data protection authority can investigate violations

**Seek legal advice** - Employment lawyers can advise on your specific situation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can my employer read my emails?

Work email accounts may be monitored, but employers should tell you this in advance. Personal communications have stronger protections. Using AI to analyze the content of your messages for emotional state or similar purposes is restricted.

### What if I work remotely?

The same rules apply whether you work from home or the office. Remote monitoring software must comply with the same standards. You should be informed about any monitoring tools on work devices.

### Can AI be used to decide if I get promoted or fired?

AI can assist in these decisions, but there must be meaningful human involvement for significant outcomes. You have the right to an explanation and, in many cases, to request human review.

### What if my employer is based outside the EU?

If you work in the EU, you're protected by EU law regardless of where your employer is headquartered. The location of the employee determines the applicable protections.
