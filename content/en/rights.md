# Your AI Rights in Europe

**You have rights.** Whether it's an algorithm deciding your loan application, AI screening your job resume, or facial recognition tracking you in public spaces—European law gives you the power to understand, question, and challenge these systems.

This isn't about understanding complex regulations. It's about knowing what you can do when AI affects your life.

## Your Four Key Rights

### 🔍 Right to Know
You have the right to know when AI is being used to make decisions about you. Organizations must tell you when automated systems are involved in decisions that affect you.

### 💡 Right to Explanation
When an AI system makes a decision about you, you can ask: *Why?* You're entitled to a meaningful explanation of how the decision was reached.

### 👤 Right to Human Review
You don't have to accept a purely automated decision. In many cases, you can request that a real person reviews the AI's decision.

### ✋ Right to Object
If you believe an AI system is treating you unfairly, you have the right to challenge it—and organizations must take your concerns seriously.

## Common Situations Where Your Rights Apply

AI touches more of our daily lives than most people realize. Here are situations where knowing your rights matters:

### At Work
From productivity monitoring to AI-assisted hiring, your workplace may use AI in ways that affect you. Some practices are restricted or even banned.

### In Public Spaces
Facial recognition and biometric surveillance have strict limits in Europe. Know what's allowed and what's not.

### When Algorithms Decide
Applying for a loan? A job? Government benefits? Algorithms often play a role in these life-changing decisions.

## What Can I Do Right Now?

If you think AI has been used in a decision that affects you:

**1. Ask if AI was involved**
You have the right to know. Ask directly: "Was any automated system or algorithm involved in this decision?"

**2. Request an explanation**
If AI was used, ask for a clear explanation of how the decision was made and what factors were considered.

**3. Ask for human review**
If you're unhappy with an automated decision, request that a human reviews your case. This is especially important for significant decisions.

**4. Document everything**
Keep records of your communications and any decisions you receive. This helps if you need to challenge something later.

**5. Know where to complain**
If an organization won't respect your rights, you can contact your national data protection authority or consumer protection agency.

## The Legal Foundation

Your rights come from two landmark pieces of European legislation:

**The EU AI Act** (2024) is the world's first comprehensive AI law. It bans certain AI practices entirely and sets strict requirements for high-risk AI systems.

**The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** (2018) gives you rights over your personal data, including the right to know about and challenge automated decisions.

These laws work together to protect you. You don't need to understand every detail—just know that the law is on your side.
